		<span class="linksubheading">Stanford University</span><br>
		The traditional Word2Vec model has lead to significant improvements in the field of NLP, but has a limitation that good vector representations are not learned for: Rare words Words that are not seen in the training corpus This problem is more prominent in case of morphologically rich languages (e.g. German). To overcome these, we incorporated the information about the character n-grams that each word is made of into its vector representation and assess the performance of the vectors using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods.

		<span class="linksubheading">Stanford University</span><br>
		Autonomous navigation in unseen environments has many applications including disaster, rescue and exploration. In this project, we developed a method to obtain a path to a desired destination in an unseen environment based on local sensor data as input. We are using Q-learning approach to make an optimal decision. Q value is obtained from function approximation using a neural network.

		<a href="cnc.html" class="linkheading">CNC Programming to manufacture gears on 3 axis CNC-VMC</a><br>
		<span class="linksubheading">Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar</span><br>
		Gears are produced with gear hobbing machines or fancy CNC machine, but cannot be manufactured by a 3 axis vertical milling machine as there is no way to provide involute paths in a VMC, which are the main feature of any gear tooth. This project involved developing a technique to make this possible. With existing circular interpolation in a VMC, an approximation technique was developed to manufacture involute surfaces on a VMC. In order to maintain desired quality of the gear surface irrespective of approximation, tolerancing was used to develop a protocol for deciding the fineness and accuracy required during approximation.

			<a class="linkheading d">Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Reaction Simulations</a><br>
			<span class="linksubheading">Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar</span><br>
			In order to operate hydrogen fuel cells as an energy source, a steady supply of Hydrogen is required. In limited resource environments like submarines, this Hydrogen could be obtained using autothermal reactions of hydrocarbon fuels. In order to obtain efficiency in this reaction, an optimum steam to oxygen ration is required for every fuel. This project involved autothermal reforming reaction simulations for Diesel to obtain this optimum ratio for Diesel.

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			<a href="UW.html" class="linkheading">Adhesion of Microspheres to Graphene Coated Substrates</a><br>
			<span class="linksubheading">University of Washington</span><br>
			Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, only a single or few atomic layers thick. Transferring graphene to desired substrates is a challenge as it is fragile and invisible to naked eye. This project involved discovering a method to successfully transfer graphene to aluminum, and mount microspheres on the graphene using Langmuir-Blodgett method for self-assembly, which is a challenge due to grapheneâ€™s hydrophobic nature.

			<a class="linkheading d">CFD Simulations: Fontan Surgery</a><br>
			<span class="linksubheading">Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay</span><br>
			A Fontan heart surgery involves bypassing the right ventricle and diverting the blood from the IVC and SVC directly to the pulmonary arteries. This creates turbulence and energy loss in the flow. This summer internship involved creating CFD simulations of this blood flow using various offsets in the connections and analyzing the vortex formations and pressure distributions in the flow patterns.
