Autonomous navigation in unseen environments has many applications including disaster, rescue and exploration. In this project, we developed a method to obtain a path to a desired destination in an unseen environment based on local sensor data as input. We are using Q-learning approach to make an optimal decision. Q value is obtained from function approximation using a neural network.
