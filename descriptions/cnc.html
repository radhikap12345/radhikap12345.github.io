Traditionally gears are manufactured using gear hobbing and shaping which require 
special machines. Gears are not manufactured on a 3 axis vertical milling centre (VMC) as 
there is no feature to program the CNC milling machine to cut involute profiles
 which are an essential part of a gear tooth. 
This project enables manufacturing of gears on 3 axis CNC-VMC possible, by using CNC milling machine to 
create involute shapes.<br>

This was accomplished by approximating the involute of a circle  by circular arcs.

Tolerancing was used to maintain the quality of approximate profile.
Varying tolerance range it was possible to program gears for various grades. 
<br>
An algorithm was developed that automatically generated the G-code for the a gear by inputting the diameter, module and desired grade of the gear.
Table 1 shows the generated G-code for a single gear tooth
