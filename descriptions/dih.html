Designing product for construction labor

Carrying heavy loads on head, these construction laborers walk several mile everyday 
and carry materials up-down across building storeys using barely made stairways. 

The project involved Interviewing the construction workers to find their pressing 
health needs, and developing and prototyping a product to cater to the specific 
requirements through design methodology concepts.

The most pressing needs were carrying loads vertically and excessive use of arm strength
<br>
Our solution was a paddle operated portable crane that could transfer loads across two storeys.
Further step would be to electrically operate the crane.
