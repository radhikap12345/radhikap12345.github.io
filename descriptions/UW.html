Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, only a single or few atomic layers thick. Transferring graphene to desired substrates is a challenge as it is fragile and invisible to naked eye. This project involved discovering a method to successfully transfer graphene to aluminum, and mount microspheres on the graphene using Langmuir-Blodgett method for self-assembly, which is a challenge due to grapheneâ€™s hydrophobic nature.
