<h3><a name="toNLP"> Word2Vec using Character n-grams, Stanford University</a></h3>
The traditional Word2Vec model has lead to significant improvements in the field of NLP, but has a limitation that good vector representations are not learned for:
Rare words
Words that are not seen in the training corpus
This problem is more prominent in case of morphologically rich languages (e.g. German).
To overcome these, we incorporated the information about the character n-grams that each word is made of into its vector representation and assess the performance of the vectors using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods.

<h3><a name="toML"> Motion Planning in Unknown Environments, Stanford University</a></h3>
Autonomous navigation in unseen environments has many applications including disaster, 
rescue and exploration. In this project, we developed a method to obtain a path to a 
desired destination in an unseen environment based on local sensor data as input.
 We are using Q-learning approach to make an optimal decision. 
Q value is obtained from function approximation using a neural network.

<h3><a name="toCNC"> CNC Proframming to manufacture gears on 3 axis CNC-VMC, IIT Gandhinagar</a></h3>
Gears are produced with gear hobbing machines or fancy CNC machine, but cannot be 
manufactured by a 3 axis vertical milling machine as there is no way to provide involute 
paths in a VMC, which are the main feature of any gear tooth. This project involved 
developing a technique to make this possible. With existing circular interpolation 
in a VMC, an approximation technique was developed to manufacture involute surfaces 
on a VMC. In order to maintain desired quality of the gear surface irrespective of 
approximation, tolerancing was used to develop a protocol for deciding the fineness and
accuracy required during approximation.<br>

<h3><a name="toDIH"> Designing for Indian Healthcare, IIT Gandhinagar</a></h3>
The project analyzed conditions of construction workers in India carrying loads on their heads and 
its adverse effects on their health with an aim to design, develop and prototype of a solution for 
their major need.<br>

<h3><a name="toHEAT"> Autothermal Reforming of Diesel Reaction Simulations, IIT Gandhinagar</a></h3>
In order to operate hydrogen fuel cells as an energy source, a steady supply of Hydrogen 
is required. In limited resource environments like submarines, this Hydrogen could be 
obtained using autothermal reactions of hydrocarbon fuels. In order to obtain efficiency
in this reaction, an optimum steam to oxygen ration is required for every fuel. This 
project involved autothermal reforming reaction simulations for Diesel to obtain this 
optimum ratio for Diesel.  

<h3><a name="to3D"> Rendering and Animating 3D Graphics scenes, IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>
Used HTML and Three.js to create and animate the interior of a room scene with mirrors, lights and shadows

<h3><a name="toMDS"> Molecular Dynamic Simulations of Silicon Nanowire, IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>
Using nano-scale heat transfer techniques and equations, MATLAB was
 used to simulate silicon nanowire structures. The heat transfer equations and boundary conditions were 
imposed on this nanowire structure to estimate the conductivity of the system using the Green-Kubo
 relation.

<h3><a name="toSPPTD"> Solar Paper Pulp Tile Dryer, IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>
Tiles manufactured using paper pulp are dried in furnace dryers requiring fuel. This project aimed to
 analyze the use of solar dryers for this purpose by analyzing weather data and evaporation rates.<br>

<h3><a name="toOBHRM"> Competency Profiles Mapping (OB&HRM), IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>
Generated competency profiles for administrative and non-administrative positions 
in IIT Gandhinagar through interviews to better understand organizational roles.<br>

<h3><a name="toHINDI"> Compression for Hindi Language Documents, IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>
Analyzed character frequencies from text documents in Hindi and implemented Huffman algorithm 
for compressing the documents using the analyzed frequencies

<h3><a name="toEG"> Designing: Engineering Graphics, IIT Gandhinagar </a></h3>

<h3><a name="toMETAMATERIALS"> Adhesion of Microspheres to Graphene Coated Substrates, University of Washington</a></h3>
Graphene is a two dimensional hexagonal lattice of carbon, only a single or few atomic layers thick.
Transferring graphene to desired substrates is a challenge as it is fragile and invisible to naked eye.
This project involved discovering a method to successfully transfer graphene to aluminum, 
and mount microspheres on the graphene using Langmuir-Blodgett method for self-assembly, 
which is a challenge due to grapheneâ€™s hydrophobic nature.<br>

<h3><a name="toCFD"> CFD Simulations: Fontan Surgery, IIT Bombay </a></h3>
A Fontan heart surgery involves bypassing the right ventricle and diverting the blood from
 the IVC and SVC directly to the pulmonary arteries. This creates turbulence and energy loss
 in the flow. This summer internship involved creating CFD simulations of this blood flow using 
various offsets in the connections and analyzing the vortex formations and pressure distributions
 in the flow patterns. <br>
